             <vmc>

The lil' shell script that makes managing VMWare Server 2 virtual machines simple and easy :)

-{ EXAMPLES }-

Example 1. Starting a VM named linux.vmx
$ vmc start linux

Example 2. Pause a VM named windows2k.vmx
$ vmc pause windows2k

-{ NOTE }-

Currently, the script uses the name of the vmx file (wo the extention) as the directory that contains the vmx. I originally did this because I configured my vm's that way. At some point, I'll mod the script so it checks for a '/' in the vm name and if it finds one it will tack on .vmx to the end of the name and use it as the vmx location.
